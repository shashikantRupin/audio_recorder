I have converted the Audio Recording into base64 text format to save it into the mongoDB.
then I decoded that base64 format to put it in as voice in a audio player.

I used the concurrently library so that you can use npm run dev command in the parent directory,
to run both the client Side and Server Side simultaneously.
